    // How do we convert the base form of a noun into its plural form?  There are a few rules for doing this.
    // We will often simply append the letter 's'.  For example, one cat or two cats.
    // Sometimes we will append the letters 'es'.  For example, one box or two boxes.
    // Sometimes the base and plural form are the same.  For example, one fish or two fish.
    // Sometimes the plural form cannot be made using a simple rule, it's just different.
    // For example, one man, two men.  Another example: one person, two people.
